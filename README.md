Hello👋🏽 I'm a student learning how to develop games. I don't have any experience with GitHub, so I still learning how to use it.
My favorite hobbies are to play videogames🎮, sleep😴, spend time with my family👨‍👨‍👧‍👦, and listen to music👂.
I like to create models and enviroments using blender. But I want to develop my skills into the coding aspect of game development. 
A few of my goals in game development are to create a FPS or a platformer.
